    My Full Name is Baiwei Liu, my English name is “Bailey”, my student email address is s3778909@student.rmit.edu.au. 
    I have been studying in Australia for 5 years, I came to Australia in 2015 to attend a language school for half a year and then study in high school in 2016, so I'm good at writing analysis, my nationality is China.
    I’m very interested in Information technology and I love to explore the information about mobile phones. 
    My passion in IT is to learn new products, new ideas, new methods, I’m willing to learn and explore these new technologies.
    My strong point on IT is to use html/css to make a website, my weak point on IT is programming. 
    It's hard for me to make an application use Java, but I believe I can carry on and overcome these problems. 
    I can contribute to our team by writing analysis about the project and making a web page. 
    I can also challenge myself to use the Java programming language to contribute to our team, that can also help me learn more about Java.

    My RMIT Student Number is: s3843689
    My Personal Email address: Jerryma20010613@gmail.com
    My RMIT email address: s3843689@student.rmit.edu.au
    Hello, my name is Yi Tao Ma, 'Ethan' is my English name, I am from China and I immigrated to Australia in 2016 and have studied in Australia since ninth grade and finish my year 12 in 2019. 
    Chinese is my first language and unfortunately, I cannot celebrate most Chinese traditional festivals due to the long distance from Melbourne to China: 8463 km. 
    Which also makes me miss a lot of delicious Chinese food. Indeed, I missed my home country, but I also try to fit in Australia, learn Australian cultures and many others. 
    I believe I will be fine during the life of RMIT and Australia.
    I started to learn how to play the piano when I was 5 years old and I passed the piano level 10 examination. 
    Sometimes I still play the piano to make sure I do not forget the piano skills. I also love to cook some traditional Chinese food: Fried Noodles/Rice etc. 
    You know it is well to have some cooking skills to ensure you can keep yourself away from the starving.
    I often learn about the history of some computers and different kinds of programming. I think the code is very interesting because when I complete a complete program, I will experience an incomparable sense of accomplishment. 
    Today's world life is inseparable from it, it involves many fields, learning it can let me in the future in a better society. 
    Although the code and its knowledge are boring, it is the basis of the whole world, so I am still passionate about it.
    My weakness is java programming and databases, but it is not very weak. I can only say that I am not very skilled. I will work harder to master my weakness this semester, and I believe it will become better.
    I hope to play the role of web programming and Research (writing) in the project. Of course, it can also help to do some Java and database work.

    My name is Xin Lin, you can call me Lynn. I am from China, and I came to Australia to study in 2018. Before that, I finished my international business studies in China. 
    Then I worked for a year. I found that I was not interested in business, and then came to Australia to continue my study. 
    This is my second year of studying information technology. I just graduated from the Diploma of Information Technology last year. 
    In the process of learning IT, I think I am good at web programming, and I am very interested in it. In terms of database and Java, I think it needs to be improved. 
    I will do my best in this team project, work hard with the team members, and learn the aspects I am not good at.

<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="projectjustification">
  <p> <h5><center> Project Justification </center></h5></p>
  <p> <b> 1. Workload </b> </p>
  <p>
    We are expecting at least forming up one group meeting per week,
    and the duration of each meeting should be at least one hour to share what we have done for the project individually.
  </p>

  <p> <b> 2. Beyong Current Capabilities </b> </p>
  <p>
    Most of our team members are good at html development,
    java programming and database skills are the areas that the majority of us are looking forward to improving.
  </p>

  <p> <b> 3. Project Risks and Challenges</b> </p>
  <p>
    Risks are the facts that discourages a project where the team members must face and overcome it.
    Decisions make risks more powerful and sometimes avoid them without any problem.
    Unfortunately, there are some risks and challenge that we will have to face while developing our project as team members.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Data Security: </b>
      <p>
        Data is the most significant aspect in the tech industry where the security of data breaches most of the time.
        Data of the project should not leak outside.
        Project data is sensitive, and all our team members should work to protect them with responsibility and care throughout the process.
        Also, data of the users must be protected and  implement a better security plan for the application.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> User Group: </b>
      <p>
        Developing an application for the wrong target users is a nightmare that can have as a project itself.
        If the chosen target user group refuses the app,
        it will be one of the biggest risks that can happen to a project after creating the application because it costs the money and hard work which the whole team spent through the process.
        Also, it will be the failure of the application in the first place.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Game Type: </b>
      <p>
        Games are now diverse and complicate. It is important to choose the type of games that we are supposed to develop.
        As our project is face to the whole society, this means our customers may be teenagers under 18 or adults.
        Therefore, games that we develop should consider the scale, which cannot be too violent and sexual related.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b> Team Dynamics related challenges: </b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Number of Group Meetings </b>
      <p>
        Since every team members are busy with different subjects and lots of assessments,
        it will be a challenge for us to gather together and have meetings.
        And also, in the situation like this, the only way to communicate is through online meeting.
        However, we will find out solutions for this after few weeks' collaboration, and hope we can overcome this challenge.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Wide Spectrum of Opinions </b>
      <p>
        As a group of six members, everyone has their own opinions and ideas.
        When it comes to draw a conclusion or make a decision, it will be difficult to finalize it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Jump out of "Comfort Zone' and Collaborate </b>
      <p>
        Six members may good at six different domains. It is challenge to acknowledge what we are good at and what we expect to improve.
        However, this does not mean members in the team should do all things that they not very good at.
        It is to collaborate and give full play to the best of the individual to help the team,
        in order to get high score.
      </p>
