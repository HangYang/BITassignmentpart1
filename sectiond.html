          <b>Github:</b>
          <p>
          Github has been a helpful instrument in completing this project.
          Through Git, we could identify who modified the codes, who added their work and which part they have changed.
          It was also easier to use as the platform is simple to understand, even for someone that does not really have deep knowledge in IT.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Eclipse:</b>
          <p>
          Eclipse is an open source, Java based, extensible development platform, and it is completely free of charge.
          It  makes it a development tool for C + +, python, PHP and other languages through plug-ins.
          We can write code in the eclipse to build our Java based project.
          We use this tool because it is simple and necessary for a Java based project.
          Alternatively we can use IntelliJ IDE or NetBeans as the programming tool, these are also free and helpful tools.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b> Visual Studio Code </b>
          <p>
            Visual studio code (vs Code) is a free code editor developed by Microsoft and supports windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems.
            It is usually used for web development, it is a good tool as it contains several features such as code completion, code fragment and code refactoring.
            The editor supports user personalization, such as changing theme color, keyboard shortcut and other attributes and parameters.

            </h4>
            </p>
            <p>
                For the communication expectation of our group,
                first of all, we must be clear about our expectations and what we want,
                and be well prepared to communicate orally or in writing.
                When we are in each meeting, we need to present our ideas in concise language and make clear what you
                want and what you need to ensure team consistency.
                In the process of communication, we should listen to the ideas of other team members carefully. To be a
                good listener is also part of the expectation of communication.
                At the end of each meeting, we can record the thoughts of other members of the group and think about it
                or adopt it.
                When our group meets in Microsoft teams next time, we can discuss common expectations and agree with
                each other's views.
            </p>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rule 1: All members must prepare their reports before attending the meeting to improve efficiency.
                </li>

                <li>Rule 2: All members must attend all weekly meetings (including mentor, lecture and private meetings)
                    to ensure that everyone is doing the right thing.</li>

                <li>Rule 3: All members must work on the project (can be individually allocated part or group part)
                    every week to promote project progress and ensure efficiency.</li>

                <li>Rule 4: All members must update the progress on Trello weekly to ensure everyone on the same page
                </li>

                <li>Rule 5: All members must take the project seriously, try their best to complete their allocated
                    parts and help others to maximize efficiency.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <h5>
                    <center> Decision-making Processes </center>
                </h5>
                </p>
            <p> If something occurred unexpectedly, group member could help to achieve the expectation together.
                Other problems of technical issues or member issues could also be solved together. We can check each
                member's
                progress on Trello to see the progress that we can decide to work harder or change the plan, etc. So,
                we all agreed this method is an effective method to use. The expected frequency of responses would be at
                least
                twice a week that each member can know the other's progress through Trello.
                The weekly workflow will be determined mainly in the Trello board and also in the Google DOC(since we
                have about everything in our DOC as a draft). </p>

            <p>
                Our group will hold a meeting with lecturer and tutor every week.
                After teachers’ suggestions, we can have another meeting to discuss and make decisions.
                Before that, we should collect enough information. Resources can be searched from canvas or the
                Internet.
                In the decision-making process, we should consider various factors, including advantages, disadvantages,
                potential risks, and whether the goal can be successfully achieved.
                When team members disagree, we can communicate with each other to explain the pros and cons of our
                views.
                Voting is also a good way to decide.
            </p>
