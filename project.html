      <p><h6>Project Description:</h6></p>
        <p>We are thinking about building a website for a game store. And the most important is how to attract customers.
          <br>Our website will use html,css,javascript,php as the basis. 
          There will be databases to store user information and product information. There will also be an online game page to use in java.
          <br>Our website will have four pages with a drop-down menu function.  (home page, store page, play with us page, contact us page) 
          The main page will have some game information, such as gaming news, new games, upcoming games and discount games. These will be displayed separately using the drop-down menu function.
          In the store page, users can login and purchase products. These include games on different platforms, game related and Gaming devices. 
          We also created a special web page called “play with us”. In this page, we provide a small game and we will make a ranking list. 
          All users can challenge high scores. According to the score of the ranking list, get the corresponding discount. The ranking list will update every day.
          Finally is the contact us page, there will be a form through which users can submit any questions they have. Also there is an about us page can be displayed in the drop-down menu.

  <p> <b> 1. Workload </b> </p>
  <p>
    We are expecting at least forming up one group meeting per week,
    and the duration of each meeting should be at least one hour to share what we have done for the project individually.
  </p>

  <p> <b> 2. Beyong Current Capabilities </b> </p>
  <p>
    Most of our team members are good at html development,
    java programming and database skills are the areas that the majority of us are looking forward to improving.
  </p>

  <p> <b> 3. Project Risks and Challenges</b> </p>
  <p>
    Risks are the facts that discourages a project where the team members must face and overcome it.
    Decisions make risks more powerful and sometimes avoid them without any problem.
    Unfortunately, there are some risks and challenge that we will have to face while developing our project as team members.
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Data Security: </b>
      <p>
        Data is the most significant aspect in the tech industry where the security of data breaches most of the time.
        Data of the project should not leak outside.
        Project data is sensitive, and all our team members should work to protect them with responsibility and care throughout the process.
        Also, data of the users must be protected and  implement a better security plan for the application.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> User Group: </b>
      <p>
        Developing an application for the wrong target users is a nightmare that can have as a project itself.
        If the chosen target user group refuses the app,
        it will be one of the biggest risks that can happen to a project after creating the application because it costs the money and hard work which the whole team spent through the process.
        Also, it will be the failure of the application in the first place.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Game Type: </b>
      <p>
        Games are now diverse and complicate. It is important to choose the type of games that we are supposed to develop.
        As our project is face to the whole society, this means our customers may be teenagers under 18 or adults.
        Therefore, games that we develop should consider the scale, which cannot be too violent and sexual related.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p><b> Team Dynamics related challenges: </b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b> Number of Group Meetings </b>
      <p>
        Since every team members are busy with different subjects and lots of assessments,
        it will be a challenge for us to gather together and have meetings.
        And also, in the situation like this, the only way to communicate is through online meeting.
        However, we will find out solutions for this after few weeks' collaboration, and hope we can overcome this challenge.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Wide Spectrum of Opinions </b>
      <p>
        As a group of six members, everyone has their own opinions and ideas.
        When it comes to draw a conclusion or make a decision, it will be difficult to finalize it.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> Jump out of "Comfort Zone' and Collaborate </b>
      <p>
        Six members may good at six different domains. It is challenge to acknowledge what we are good at and what we expect to improve.
        However, this does not mean members in the team should do all things that they not very good at.
        It is to collaborate and give full play to the best of the individual to help the team,
        in order to get high score.
      </p>

  <p> <b> 1.Resources & Tools </b> </p>
<p>
    [- Tools/Resources name - Short description - Rationale (Why we are using this tool) - Specific version and Cost - Describe any alternatives that we didn’t use]
Git Repository
Git repository has been a helpful instrument in completing this project. Through Git, we could identify who modified the codes, who added their work and which part they have changed. It was also easier to use as the platform is simple to understand, even for someone that does not really have deep knowledge in IT.

Eclipse
Eclipse is an open source, Java based, extensible development platform, and it is completely free of charge. It  makes it a development tool for C + +, python, PHP and other languages through plug-ins. We can write code in the eclipse to build our Java based project. We use this tool because it is simple and necessary for a Java based project. Alternatively we can use IntelliJ IDE or NetBeans as the programming tool, these are also free and helpful tools.

Visual Studio Code
Visual studio code (vs Code) is a free code editor developed by Microsoft and supports windows, Linux and MacOS operating systems. It is usually used for web development, it is a good tool as it contains several features such as code completion, code fragment and code refactoring. The editor supports user personalization, such as changing theme color, keyboard shortcut and other attributes and parameters.

<p> <b> 2. Collaborative Workspaces </b> </p>
<p>Trello:https://trello.com/b/GrrGPFy7/hd</p>
<p>Create a teamboard in Trello, our team members can see the progress of the work , 
             mentor’s announcements  and team members’ cards.</p>

<p>MSTeam：AR-TH-930-HD</p>
<p>This is our private team channel in Microsoft teams and we have regular group meetings.</p>

<p>GoogleDrive:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C1aQNwknA6w9rEQDBPK6EtkLTcARFTevNG6Rtm_-pLQ/edit</p>
<p>Create a document in Google drive where each member of our team can write the outline and details of our project.</p>

<p>Github:https://github.com/HangYang/BITassignmentpart1</p>
<p>The HTML code and files of our web page are presented in it.</p>

<p> <b> 3. Communication Expectations </b> </p>
  <p>
    For the communication expectation of our group, first of all, we must be clear about our expectations and what we want, and be well prepared to communicate orally or in writing. When we are in each meeting, we need to present our ideas in concise language and make clear what you want and what you need to ensure team consistency. In the process of communication, we should listen to the ideas of other team members carefully. To be a good listener is also part of the expectation of communication. At the end of each meeting, we can record the thoughts of other members of the group and think about it or adopt it. When our group meets in Microsoft teams next time, we can discuss common expectations and agree with each other's views.
</p>

<p> <b> 4. Decision-making Processes </b> </p>
  <p>
    Our group will hold a meeting with lecturer and tutor every week. After teachers’ suggestions, we can have another meeting to discuss and make decisions. Before that, we should collect enough information. Resources can be searched from canvas or the Internet. In the decision-making process, we should consider various factors, including advantages, disadvantages, potential risks, and whether the goal can be successfully achieved. When phter team members disagree, we can communicate with each other to explain the pros and cons of our views. Voting is also a good way to decide.
